# Awair Lambda

This repo contains Go code for a Lambda function that pulls raw data from the
Awair API and saves CSV files to S3.

# Configuration

Create a new Lambda function called **awair-to-s3** (if you want to name it something else, you'll have to update **main.go**). This is how the Lambda function should be configured.

![Function Settings](images/function-settings.png)

You'll need to configure the following environment variables in Lambda:

- `AWAIR_API_KEY`
  After joining the [Awair developer
  program](https://developer.getawair.com/onboard/welcome), you can get an [access
  token](https://developer.getawair.com/console/access-token) for pulling data for
  your device.
- `BUCKET`
  The script uses an S3 bucket to store both the compiled function binary and the
  air quality data. The function code is stored at `lambda/awair-to-s3.zip`, and
  the CSV files are stored at `airdata/[TIMESTAMP].csv`.
- `DEVICE_TYPE`
  Both device type and ID can be found by [listing out
  devices](https://docs.developer.getawair.com/?version=latest#26ca616d-b6e6-4647-a07d-5c90a23b7afe)
  through the API.
- `DEVICE_ID`

Once you have the function setup, you'll want to create a trigger for it to run. To run the function every hour, create a new CloudWatch Events trigger with a Schedule Expression equal to rate(1 hour). If you want to change the frequency of how often the Lambda function is called, just change the rate in the Schedule Expression. For more on CloudWatch Schedule Expressions, see this [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tutorial-scheduled-events-schedule-expressions.html).

# Deploying

After configuring the function in Lambda, you can use `deploy.sh` to compile the
code, upload it to S3, and update the function to use it. The `BUCKET` variable
should be updated. You'll need AWS command line tools and Go installed.

# Querying

The function runs once per hour and saves a new CSV file with three columns:
timestamp, sensor, and value. Here's what that looks like:

```
2020-01-01 16:59:55.817000,temp,23.809999465942383
2020-01-01 16:59:55.817000,humid,32.84000015258789
2020-01-01 16:59:55.817000,co2,829
2020-01-01 16:59:55.817000,voc,137
2020-01-01 16:59:55.817000,pm25,3
```

With this date format Athena can query this directly from S3.
